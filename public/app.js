// This file is intentionally left blank for the Page Plugin version.
//
// In earlier versions of this application, clientâ€‘side JavaScript was used to
// fetch posts from a server API and render them into the page. However, when
// using the Facebook Page Plugin, all rendering and interaction are handled by
// Facebook's own JavaScript inside an iframe. As a result, this file is no
// longer needed. It remains in the repository so that builds expecting a
// `public/app.js` file continue to succeed, but its contents have been
// replaced with this explanatory comment.
